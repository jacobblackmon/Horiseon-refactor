# Horiseon-refactor

##Description

Refactoring the Horiseon webpage was very enlightening and a great way to help refine my knowledge of the topics we've learned so far. When I first looked at the document and was told to refactor the code without changing the look of the webpage I was baffled and didn't think that was possible. Once I actually got into the code  in the HTML and CSS I was able to step back and reevaluate the way I think of code and went in and redid class elements, deleted unnecessary code, and really refined the page. Giving it a more user friendly interface without taking away from the website at all.
